{"title":"Analysis of Various Evaluation Measures for Diversity","authors":["P. Chandar","B. Carterette"],"details":"undefined, undefined 2011, Pages 21-28","abstract":"Evaluation measures play a vital role in analyzing the performance of a system, comparing two or more systems, and optimizing systems to perform some task. In this paper, we analyze and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used measures for evaluating the diversity in search results. We compare MAP-IA, alpha-nDCG, and ERR-IA using data from TREC'09 web track diversity runs and simulated data. We describe a class of test sets that could be used to compare evaluation measure and systems used for diversifying search results.","ptype":"INPROCEEDINGS","pdf":"chandar2011.pdf","bib":"chandar2011.bib"}
