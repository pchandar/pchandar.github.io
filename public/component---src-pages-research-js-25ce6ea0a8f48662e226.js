But modeling documents as independently relevant is more likely to produce a ranking with a high degree of redundancy; the amount of novel information available to the user may be minimal as they traverse down a ranked list. This research project attempts to remedy this with new models of document interdependence and new evaluation measures. There are three threads running through this work: (1) the models of diversity, novelty, and redundancy that will be needed to implement ranking algorithms; (2) measurements of diversity, novelty, and redundancy in a ranking of documents; and (3) optimizing model structures and parameters to the measures. As part of this project, we developed statistical models to reduce the degree of redundancy in a rank list, analyzed various evaluation frameworks, designed and conducted user studies to better understand userâ€™s need and proposed a novel preference based evaluation framework. This project resulted in various conference publications and a thesis.

As part of this project, we studied the relationship between assessor disagreement and various factors such as readability, cohesiveness, and rank at which a document is returned by a set of retrieval systems (meta-rank). To this end, we proposed a logistic regression predictive model of second assessor disagreement given meta-rank and initially-assessed relevance.

The problem involves a deep analysis of the large amounts of text. A typical system build for this problem returns a list of relevant answer snippets for a given natural language question and it is often a good idea to cluster (group) the returned answer snippets based on some criteria. In this project, our focus was on developing a novel approach to evaluate the snippet cluster returned by the system.
