When presented\nwith anytime, anywhere access to a vast catalog of music, users face\nchallenges in searching for what they want to hear. We propose\nthat users who engage in domain-specific search (e.g., music search)\nhave different information-seeking needs than in general search.\nUsing a mixed-method approach that combines a large-scale user\nsurvey with behavior data analyses, we describe the construct of\nsearch mindset on a leading online streaming music platform and\nthen investigate two types of search mindsets: focused, where a\nuser is looking for one thing in particular, and non-focused, where\na user is open to different results. Our results reveal that searches in\nthe music domain are more likely to be focused than non-focused.\nIn addition, usersâ€™ behavior (e.g., clicks, streams, querying, etc.) on\na music search system is influenced by their search mindset. Finally,\nwe propose design implications for music search systems to best\nsupport their users.","ptype":"INPROCEEDINGS","pdf":"li2019.pdf","bib":"li2019.bib","meta":"li2019.json"}
