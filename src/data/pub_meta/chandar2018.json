{"title":"Estimating Clickthrough Bias in the Cascade Model","authors":["P. Chandar","B.

Thus far, the focus has been on addressing bias that arises\ndue to the position of the document being clicked (position-bias) or\nsparsity of clicks on certain query-document pairs (selection-bias).\nHowever, there is another source of bias that could arise: the bias\ndue to the context in which a document was presented to the user.\nThe propensity of the user clicking on a document depends not\nonly on its position but also on many other contextual factors.\nIn this work, we show that the existing counterfactual estimators\nfail to capture one type of bias, speci!cally, the e\"ect on clickthrough rates due to the relevance of documents ranked above.\nFurther, we propose a modi!cation to the existing estimator that\ntakes into account this bias. We rely on full result randomization\nthat allows us to control for the click context at various ranks; we\ndemonstrate the e\"ectiveness of our methods in evaluating retrieval\nsystem through experiments on a simulation setup that is designed\nto cover a wide variety of scenarios","ptype":"INPROCEEDINGS","pdf":"chandar2018.pdf","bib":"chandar2018.bib","meta":"chandar2018.json"}
