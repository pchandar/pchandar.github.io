This study tests a similarity-based approach to recommending concepts from a text corpus to a terminology. Our approach involves extraction of candidate concepts from a given text corpus, which are represented using a set of features. The model learns the important features to characterize a concept and recommends new concepts to a terminology. Further, we propose a cost-effect evaluation methodology to estimate the effectiveness of terminology enrichment methods. To test our methodology, we use the clinical trial eligibility criteria free-text as an example text corpus to recommend concepts for SNOMED CT. We computed precision at various rank intervals to measure the performance of the methods. Results indicate that our automated algorithm is an effective method for concept recommendation.","ptype":"INPROCEEDINGS","pdf":"chandar2015.pdf","bib":"chandar2015.bib","meta":"chandar2015.json"}
