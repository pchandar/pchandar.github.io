<h3>About Me</h3>
 <p>I'm a Data Scientist  at <a href="http://www.x.ai">X.AI Inc.</a> building a AI personal assistant that automatically schedules meetings.</a> Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> working with <a href="http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/">Dr. Chunhua Weng</a> at the <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/">Biomedical Informatics Department</a>. I was a Research Assistant at the <a href="http://ir.cis.udel.edu/">Information Retrieval Lab</a> supervised by <a href="http://ir.cis.udel.edu/~carteret/">Dr. Ben Carterette</a> where I completed my Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science at <a href="http://www.udel.edu"> University of Delaware</a>. </p>

 <p>I am interested in the field of information retrieval, natural language processing and machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in the study and development of effective and efficient evaluation techniques that help measure how well retrieval systems satisfy user's information needs.
 I have worked on research problems including evaluation of retrieval and  question answering systems, web search, recommendation systems, and dialogue system for healthcare and scheduling. As a result of this work, I have created open-source tools, contributed to commercial software and published in leading academic conferences</p>
